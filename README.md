### Hi there 👋

There are tons of dating apps out there.

So why does this one exist?

Because us grown-ups (28+) who are ready for real, meaningful relationships are tired of having to co-exist with dating products that aren’t aligned with our dating and relationship goals. 
 
Update is “the dating app for grown-ups.”  A community built specifically for those who have graduated from casual dating and hook-up apps who are now at a stage in their lives where they are looking to settle down, not play around.
 
Most dating apps function essentially the same.  However, Update includes some unique features designed to alleviate the major pain points commonly experienced on dating apps, with the goal of making Update the most likeable dating app experience possible.  Some of our unique features include….
 
1. A “Ghostbusters” feature:  Ghosting sucks!  We’ve all done it and/ or been a victim of ghosting.  We get it...sometimes it’s just easier to ghost than explain why we’re unmatching.  Our ghostbusters feature does the work for you, respectfully.

Ghosting?  “No no no...not today.”  - Dikembe Mutombo. 
 
2. “Privacy Block” feature:  Preemptively block contacts from your phone book.  If any of your blocked contacts happen to be using the Update app, you will not see them, nor will they see you.  So, you might want to block your ex, your boss, co-workers, friends, frenemies, family...even your parents.  It happens.
 
3. “Behavior Score” feature:  Like an Uber Score for our users.  Each user is rated based on whether they were “respectful” or not during their interactions.  Users with perfect behavior scores receive the Behavior Score halo emoji badge on their profile.  It’s a little heads-up beforehand to help you decide whether to like or not to like based on their past interactions with others.
 
4. Transparency:  Everyone is required to answer “The Basics”, a universal set of questions designed to make Update a more transparent, and as a result, efficient dating app experience.  Answers to questions that you need to know before deciding to like someone or not.  These are often inorganic subjects that are incredibly awkward to bring up, especially early in conversation.   Questions that can often kill the conversation and your chances with someone who would otherwise be a good match for you.  For example, Have kids/ want kids.  At this stage in our lives, we need to know that up front, not waste days working up to that question only to find out you’re not on the same page. This happens often and it is a frustratingly painful waste of time.  We believe that transparency equals a more efficient dating app experience. 
 
In addition, there are many other convenient features built in to make the Update user experience the best it can possibly be.  If there is anything we can do to make the experience even better, please let us know in the “Support Chat & Feedback” section of the app.
 
Thank you for giving us a try, being an early adopter, and the very foundation of the Update community.  We are new to the app store and are actively growing our community with others like you...grown-ups who are ready for the real deal.
